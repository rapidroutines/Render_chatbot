You'll need to nail these moves first: • 10 push-ups (pushing) • 5 pull-ups (pulling) • 5 dips (upper body stability) • 10 leg raises (core control) • 10 squats (leg movement). Think of these as your checkpoints."

    "content": "These are the correct form for exercises. Push Ups: (Sagging Hips, keeping your body straight prevents hip drop, elbow flaring, keep elbows close to your sides, incomplete range, go all the way down and up, head position, look straight, don't drop your head) Pull Ups: (Using Momentum - Avoid swinging, use controlled movement, neglecting scapula, start with shoulder blades down, partial Range, reach full height, lower completely, gripping incorrectly, proper hand placement is key). Dips: (Shoulder Shrugging, keep shoulders down, elbow flaring, elbows close to your body, overarching Back, maintain a neutral back, limited Range, go down until elbows are at 90 degrees) Leg Raises (Don't use momentum, lift with core, not swings. Bending Knees, Keep legs straight throughout. Lifting Hips – Hips stay down, legs lift. Lack of Control – Lower legs slowly, controlled) Squats: (Knee Overextension – Keep knees behind toes. Leaning Forward – Stay upright, avoid leaning. Heel Lifting – Keep heels on the ground. Shallow Squats – Go deep for full benefit.)"
